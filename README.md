IMPORTANT NOTE: After two years I decided to download this project again and unfurtonately it doesn't work anymore. It seems that Blizzard has changed the API that I used to reach and Twitch has also modified the way we can search for streams and the cover picture of the header was also deleted from the source that I was getting.

It was a really useful website for me and my friends who used to play World of Warcraft, we could check level and gear of characters of all realms. It was working giving the real data about the equipment and everything on use on the character mentioned on the search field.
